# Binary Reversal

Have the function BinaryReversal(str):
* Take the str parameter being passed,wWhich will be a positive integer, 
* Take its binary representation (padded to the nearest N * 8 bits), 
* Reverse that string of bits, and then finally 
* Return the new reversed string in decimal form. 

**For example:** </br>
if str is "47" then the binary version of this integer is 101111 but we pad it to be 00101111. 

#### Your program should reverse this binary string which then becomes: 11110100 and then finally return the decimal version of this string, which is 244

**Examples**
> Input: "213" </br>
> `Output: 171`

> Input: "4567" </br>
> `Output: 60296`
